Scientists visualize quantum entanglement of photons for the first time: Researchers from the University of Ottawa and Sapienza University in Rome have developed a technique to visualize the wave function of entangled photons in real-time. Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles become interconnected, regardless of their spatial separation. This instantaneous connection challenges our understanding of how the world works and is a fundamental principle of quantum physics. The concept of entanglement was challenged by Albert Einstein and others, but subsequent experiments have confirmed its non-local nature. Wave functions, which describe a particle's quantum state, can provide insight into its properties. Quantum tomography, the process of determining a particle's wave function, is complex and time-consuming. The new technique allows for faster and higher quality results in measuring the quantum state of entangled photons.\n",

This behavior, known as Boson bunching, is a fundamental feature of quantum physics. It is generally accepted that bunching occurs when photons are indistinguishable but vanishes when they can be distinguished. However, the research team found instances where photon bunching increased, contrary to expectations, when the photons became partially distinguishable. This discovery challenges our current understanding of multiparticle interference in the realm between indistinguishable bosons and classical particles.
