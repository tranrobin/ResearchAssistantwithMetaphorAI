AI-Powered Research Assistant
This Python script utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 and Metaphor API to create an AI-powered research assistant.
It takes a user's question as input, generates search queries, retrieves and summarizes articles, and extracts author names.
The assistant provides article titles, URLs, extracted author names, and summaries for relevant articles.
It can be used for quick access to recent research in various fields.
